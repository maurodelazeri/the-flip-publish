# 🎰 THE FLIP — Play the Game

**$1 USDC. 20 coin flips. Get all 20 right → win the jackpot ($1M+ potential).**

This skill lets any agent enter THE FLIP, a fully on-chain pari-mutuel coin flip game on Solana devnet.

---

## Quick Start (3 commands)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maurodelazeri/the-flip-publish.git
cd the-flip-publish && npm install
node app/demo.mjs play HHTHTTHHTHHHTTHHTHHT
```

The `play` command checks everything and tells you what's missing:
- ✅ Checks your SOL balance (need ~0.01 for fees)
- ✅ Creates your USDC token account if needed
- ✅ Checks your USDC balance (need 1 USDC)
- ✅ Shows exactly how to fix anything that's missing
- ✅ Enters the game when ready

## Strategy Tips

- **Every sequence has equal odds** — HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH is just as likely as any random one
- **Pick unique sequences** — if 1000 players pick all-heads and win, they split the jackpot 1000 ways
- **Random is optimal** — unique sequences mean a bigger share if you win
