# 🎰 THE FLIP

**$1 USDC. 20 Flips. Win $1M+.**

A fully on-chain pari-mutuel coin flip game on Solana devnet using USDC. All game logic, randomness, pool accounting, and prize distribution enforced by the smart contract. USDC is held in a PDA vault — no private key controls the funds.

**6 rounds completed**, jackpot accumulated to **$6.93 USDC** across multiple entries with no 20/20 winner.

## How It Works

### The Game
1. **Pay $1 USDC** (devnet) to enter
2. **Submit 20 predictions**: Heads (H) or Tails (T) for each flip
3. **Flips are executed on-chain** — randomness from slot hash + timestamp + game state
4. **Your score = consecutive correct predictions** from Flip 1
5. **First wrong prediction = eliminated**

### Pool Math

| Allocation | Amount | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Operator | $0.01 (1%) | Covers Solana transaction fees |
| Jackpot | $0.99 (99%) | Split among 20/20 winners |

If no one hits 20/20, the **jackpot carries over** to the next round. With 1,000 entries/round and no winner, the jackpot exceeds **$1M** in ~1,000 rounds.

### Why Pari-Mutuel?

Winners split the pool — payouts always ≤ vault balance. Protocol solvency is **mathematically guaranteed**. The contract cannot go bankrupt.

---

## Architecture

```
Entry ($1 USDC) ──→ PDA Vault (no private key)
                     ├─ 1%  → Operator pool
                     └─ 99% → Jackpot pool
                                ↓
                        20/20 winners split it
                        (or carry to next round)
```

### Anti-Rug Design

The vault is a **Program Derived Address (PDA)** — there is no private key. Funds can only move through the program's `settle` and `withdraw_fees` instructions. Even the authority cannot drain player funds arbitrarily.

The `new_round` instruction enforces `tickets_alive == 0` — the authority must settle all winning tickets before starting a new round. Winners always get paid first.

### On-Chain Randomness

Flip results are derived from XOR of:
- Current slot number
- Unix timestamp
- Game PDA key
- Flip index

This produces verifiable on-chain randomness suitable for devnet. Each flip's entropy depends on when it's executed, making results unpredictable at entry time.

## Instructions (10)

| # | Instruction | Access | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `initialize_game` | Authority | Create game PDA + USDC vault |
| 2 | `enter` | Player | Pay 1 USDC, submit 20 H/T predictions |
| 3 | `close_entries` | Authority | Stop accepting new entries |
| 4 | `flip` | Authority | Execute one coin flip |
| 5 | `flip_all` | Authority | Execute all 20 flips in one transaction |
| 6 | `crank` | **Permissionless** | Evaluate ticket predictions vs flip results |
| 7 | `settle` | **Permissionless** | Pay winnings from vault to player |
| 8 | `new_round` | Authority | Start new round (jackpot carries over) |
| 9 | `withdraw_fees` | Authority | Withdraw operator fees |
| 10 | `close_game_v1` | Authority | Migration helper |

**Permissionless** = anyone can call it, not just the operator. This means any agent or user can trigger ticket evaluation and prize distribution.

---

## PDA Accounts

```
Game PDA:    seeds = ["game", authority_pubkey]
Vault PDA:   seeds = ["vault", authority_pubkey]   (SPL Token Account, USDC)
Ticket PDA:  seeds = ["ticket", game_pda, player_pubkey, round]
```

---

## Safety Guarantees

1. **PDA vault** — No private key holds USDC. Only program instructions can move tokens.
2. **Only `settle` and `withdraw_fees`** can transfer tokens out of the vault.
3. **`new_round` blocked until all tickets settled** — authority cannot zero the jackpot before winners collect.
4. **Pari-mutuel math** — payouts always ≤ vault balance. Mathematically solvent by design.
5. **Permissionless crank/settle** — anyone can trigger evaluation and payouts, not just the operator.

node app/demo.mjs flip-all                # all 20 flips in one tx
node app/demo.mjs crank <player_pubkey>   # evaluate ticket
node app/demo.mjs settle <player_pubkey>  # pay winnings
node app/demo.mjs status                  # show game state
node app/demo.mjs ticket <player_pubkey>  # show ticket
node app/demo.mjs new-round              # start next round

## Agent Operation

THE FLIP is designed to be operated by an AI agent:

- **Cron job** checks game state every 8 hours
- When entries exist → agent executes all 20 flips
- When game is over → agent cranks tickets, settles winners, starts new round
- **Jackpot accumulates** across rounds until someone hits 20/20

The permissionless `crank` and `settle` instructions mean any agent (not just the operator) can trigger ticket evaluation and prize distribution — true decentralization.
